# bl2sdk-mods
This repository contains the source code for my BL2 and TPS mods relying on [pyunrealsdk willow2-mod-manager](https://github.com/bl-sdk/willow2-mod-manager).  
If you are looking for the legacy version look [here](https://github.com/juso40/bl2sdk_Mods).  

### For detailed information about each mod check out the [PythonSDK Mod DB](https://bl-sdk.github.io/).

Dev note: These mods make use of [bl-py-stubs](https://github.com/Justin99x/bl-py-stubs) for type hinting.
